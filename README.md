Coding Challenge Plugin
---
This is a Wordpress plugin I built for coding challenge. It had a 4 hour time limit with the parameters below:
- Develop a plugin that utilizes the WordPress REST API to pull a list of most recently published posts from 3 to 5 other WordPress sites and display that list as a Dashboard widget in the WordPress admin. 
- The list shall contain all posts/pages/custom post types and display 10 items by default; the user shall be able to change the number of items displayed. 
- The user shall also have the ability to filter the list by website, the default list shall display all sites. 
- A link/button to manually approve each post shall accompany each post in the list. 
- When a user approves a post, the approval, username and a time stamp shall be passed to the site containing that page and each shall be stored in custom meta fields. 
- Also, once approved, the post shall no longer appear in the list of recently published posts.
